# Piffin experimenter's kit

Thank you for purchasing our Raspberry Pi Lab Kit. We have put everything together to make it easy to teach ICT content in a classroom environment and tested everything we thought necessary.

# Build your Raspberry Pi holder

We designed the holder to keep your Raspberry Pi and breaboard next to each other to encourage electronic prototyping. See the image and instructions below to help you build yours.

[3D visualisation of how to assemble the holder etc]

### RPIH assembly instructions

- Locate the plastic holder and 'Hardware' bag of parts.

- Locate and unpack your Raspberry Pi.

- Peel off backing from the plastic holder.

- Attach 6 of the rubber bumpers to the underside of the plastic holder - on the circle outlines.

- Attach the remaining 2 bumpers to the other side of the plastic holder - above the full etched circles.

- Peel off the backing from the breadboard and stick to the plastic holder. 

- Put 2x bolts through the plastic holder, the spacers on the bolts, the Raspberry Pi on the spacers and finally the nuts to hold everything in place.

- Your Raspberry Pi prototyping holder is assembled and ready to use









# Download the code

Now that you have assembled your Raspberry Pi and breadboard holder connect your Raspberry Pi to a power supply, display, mouse and keyboard and wait for it to boot up.

When ready, open a terminal window and type

    wget https://github.com/mattvenn/piffin/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    cd experimenter-kit
