# Piffin Lab Kit

Thank you for purchasing our Raspberry Pi Lab Kit. We've spent a lot of time making it easier to teach computer science with the Raspberry Pi and electronics in a classroom environment. To get started, go to our documentation and schemes of work online: [doc.piffin.co.uk](http://doc.piffin.co.uk).

# Build your Raspberry Pi holder

We designed the holder to keep your Raspberry Pi and breadboard next to each other to encourage electronic prototyping. See the image and instructions below to help you build yours.

- Locate the plastic holder and 'Hardware' bag of parts.
- Locate and unpack your Raspberry Pi.
- Peel off backing from the plastic holder.
- Attach 6 of the rubber bumpers to the underside of the plastic holder - on the circle outlines.
- Attach the remaining 2 bumpers to the other side of the plastic holder - above the full etched circles.
- Peel off the backing from the breadboard and stick to the plastic holder. 
- Put 2x bolts through the plastic holder, the spacers on the bolts, the Raspberry Pi on the spacers and finally add and tighten the nuts to hold everything in place.
- Your Raspberry Pi prototyping holder is assembled and ready to use
