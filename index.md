# Electronic Components

The easiest way to provide the components you need is to buy the [Raspberry Pi lab kit from us at Piffin](http://www.piffin.co.uk/collections/shophome/products/raspberry-pi-lab-kit).

You can also build a kit yourself that includes the following components:

* 30 LEDs,
* 30 buttons,
* 200 female to male wires,
* 100 male to male wires,
* 15 breadboards.

We advise buying at least 20% more than you need to account for losses. 

The Raspberry Pi holder makes things a lot easier, so either [buy one from us - includes breadboard](http://www.piffin.co.uk/collections/shophome/products/raspberry-pi-prototyping-bundle-without-raspberry-pi), or [download the file](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:231352) and get it made on your school's laser cutter or at the [local hackspace](http://www.hackspace.org.uk/view/Main_Page).
