# flashing an LED

Flashing an LED is a good first example. The code is commented well, so be sure to read that.

# Connections

##circuit diagram here

add an LED and a resistor in series to pin 8 of the header. There is an example circuit on the workshop resources. If the LED doesn't turn on, it may be because the pin isn't turned on already (see the section below), or because the circuit is broken.

## copy things to check.

## how to run the program

* sudo
* python

# Turning all outputs on with the all_on.py script

This can be run at the beginning of a workshop to ensure that all the Pi's outputs are switched on. This helps with debugging the electrical circuits.

Run it by typing this on the command line:
    
    sudo python all_on.py
