## What do we need for a reaction timer? : 30 minutes

### Resources

* Program cards.
* Computer with python ready to demonstrate random library

### Overview

* Discuss what hardware is needed.
* Discuss how the software will work.
* The one thing we will need that hasn't been covered is generating a random time interval. Ask how we could achieve this. Demonstrate random.randint() and get students to fill in one of their blank cards.
* Students use program cards to lay out a program on the desk.
* Agree on a program structure for everyone to follow
* Students write the start of the reaction timer code by copying the structure as comments
