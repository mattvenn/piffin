# Raspberry Pi Reaction Timer

Welcome to the KS3/4 scheme of work for simple electronics and Python with the Raspberry Pi!

# Learning outcomes

Students will learn:

* What the Pi is, how to plug it together.
* Learn to control the Raspberry Pi using Python.
* Learn how to build simple circuits with buttons and LEDs.

# Resources

For a class of 30, you will need:

* 15 Raspberry Pis
* 15 NOOBS SD cards,
* 15 USB keyboards, mice,
* 15 HDMI monitors,
* 15 [Piffin Lab Kits](http://piffin.co.uk).

# Electronics

The easiest way to provide the components you need is to buy the [Raspberry Pi lab kit from us at Piffin](http://piffin.co.uk).

You can also build a kit yourself that includes the following components:

* 30 LEDs,
* 30 Switches,
* 100 female to male wires,
* 100 male to male wires,
* 15 breadboards.

We advise buying at least 20% more than you need to account for losses. 

Also, the Raspberry Pi holder makes things a lot easier, so either [buy one from us](http://www.piffin.co.uk/collections/shophome/products/raspberry-pi-prototyping-bundle-without-raspberry-pi), or [download the file](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:231352) and get it laser cut.
