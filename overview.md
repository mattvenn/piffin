## Elementary electronics : 20 minutes

### Resources

* Pi, doesn't need to be plugged into screen,
* LED, wires.

### Overview

Learn how to follow a circuit diagram. Use the power and ground on Raspberry Pi to light an LED

### Extension

Use a button to switch the LED.

### HW

Come up with an application that required 2 or more leds. Draw a circuit diagram.

## Python stopwatch : 20 minutes

### Resources

* Computer setup with python ready to demonstrate stopwatch

### Overview

* Introduce the Python stopwatch program. How it works.
* Use it to time yourself breaking down circuit and rebuilding.

## Flash an LED with Python : 20 minutes

### Resources

* Pi setup
* LED, resistor, wires

### Overview

* Redo circuit diagram for Pi connection
* `sudo` & `gksudo`
* Copy the code to turn on and off an LED
* Adapt the stopwatch code to make it flash forever

### Extension

* more LEDs

### HW 

* Research Raspberry Pi GPIOs. How many digital ins and outs. How many analogue ins and outs. What is the difference between analogue and digital?

## Conditional Tree : 20 minutes

### Resources

* Some A4 sheets of paper, pens

### Overview

Game to introduce branching behaviour in code

### HW

What conditions are there in making a cup of tea, walking home, doing homework?

## Detecting button presses : 20 minutes

Game to teach about pullup/down electronics todo

## Detect a button with Python : 20 minutes

### Resources

* Pi set up
* Button, wire and resistor

### Overview

* Redo circuit diagram
* Copy the code
* Test the code

### Extension

* reduce CPU usage by including a small sleep
* use interrupts

### HW

Read this webpage: one button audio book
Come up with an idea for a project that involves an LED and a button. Draw a picture of the circuit and describe how the software will work.

## What do we need for a reaction timer? : 30 minutes

### Resources

* Program cards.
* Computer with python ready to demonstrate random library

### Overview

* Discuss what hardware is needed.
* Discuss how the software will work.
* The one thing we will need that hasn't been covered is generating a random time interval. Ask how we could achieve this. Demonstrate random.randint() and get students to fill in one of their blank cards.
* Students use program cards to lay out a program on the desk.
* Agree on a program structure for everyone to follow
* Students write the start of the reaction timer code by copying the structure as comments

## Build reaction timer hardware : 20 minutes

### Resources

* Circuit diagram
* LED
* Button
* Wires, resistors

### Overview

* Follow circuit diagram to get the hardware ready. 
* Test the led and the button with programs previously written.

## Build reaction timer software : 30 minutes

### Resources

* Previously written comments
* The hardware ready and tested

### Overview

* Students work in pairs to convert the program structure agreed above into Python.

### Extension

Record 3 times and make an average
