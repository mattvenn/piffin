# Raspberry Pi Reaction Timer

Welcome to the KS3/4 scheme of work for simple electronics and Python with the Raspberry Pi!

# Learning outcomes

Students will learn:

* What the Pi is, how to plug it together.
* Learn to control the Raspberry Pi using Python.
* Learn how to build simple circuits with buttons and LEDs,
* Software design skills,
* How to build a reaction timer.

# Resources

For a class of 30, you will need:

* 15 Raspberry Pis
* 15 NOOBS SD cards,
* 15 USB keyboards, mice,
* 15 HDMI monitors,
* 15 [Piffin Lab Kits](http://piffin.co.uk) or equivalent.

# Handouts

Ensure that students keep their handouts as older ones come into use again later on. Handouts are linked from the lesson plans, or you can [download everything at once](#download).

# Lesson plans

If your students already have a basic grounding in Python, you can optionally skip the Turtle Prize (though we encourage you to enter anyway!)
