# Detecting a button press

Copy the code below into a new file called `button.py`. Remember the lines that start with a `#` are comments, and are ignored by Python. 

It's a good idea to comment your code, to help you remember what's happening when you look back at it in a few months.

***button_noloop.py

# Button circuit

Follow the diagram to build the circuit. Common problems are:

* Check the components are inserted properly, with their legs deeply inserted into the breadboard,
* You might need to press quite hard on the button to get them in properly.
