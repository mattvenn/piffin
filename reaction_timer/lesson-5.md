# The reaction timer

Now we've learnt how to setup the Pi, write some simple programs, flash an LED and detect a button - we're ready to start making some cool stuff! 

The last 2 lessons focus on building a reaction timer and then running a class competition to see who has the fastest reactions.

Students have mostly copied code and made minor modifications. This time we'll work together to plan a program and to turn it into Python using pseudo code.

# Learning objectives

Students learn:

* To plan a program by analysing a problem and using pseudo code.
* Commenting code is useful as a development aid.
* To use the `random` library

# Resources

* 15 Pis and equipment,
* 8 copies of the [Program cards](program_cards.pdf),
* 15 [copies of the handout](lesson-5-handout.html),
* 15 [copies of the cheat sheet](../cheatsheet.html),
* Pens and paper.

## What do we need for a reaction timer? : 25 minutes

Ask what hardware is needed? We react to the LED and push a button.

Discuss with the class how the software will work. 

Tell the students to get into groups of 4 and use the program cards to lay out a program sequence (from top to bottom).

After a few minutes ask 2 members of each team to walk around and get ideas from the other teams. They can ask questions, and the remaining members answer them.

If you're feeling shaky with Python, then you can ask the whole class to agree to follow one team's program structure. This will make it easier to debug code later.

Ask students to get back in pairs, and to copy the program structure into a new program in Idle called `reaction.py`.

Start each line with a `#` to make it a comment. The lines will change colour to remind them it's a comment.

## Build reaction timer software : 30 minutes

Students work in pairs to convert the comments into Python code. They can reference any of the programs they've saved so far. They should write the Python below the comment, and leave the comment in for reference.

Ask them to start at the top and to test each line of code at a time by saving and running the code.

There will be some places where they get stuck with not knowing enough Python. See below for some missing pieces.

They can also reference the cheat sheet.

### Missing pieces of Python

We've missed out 2 pieces:

* Generating random number,
* Breaking out of a loop.

These are provided in the handout.

## Reference code

***reaction.py

## Pack away : 5 minutes

Pack away the Pi.

# Homework

Continue with the homework project from the last week. Students convert the software description they came up with to comments, and then start working on converting the comments into Python code.

# Outcome

All students:

* Understand what components are necessary for a reaction timer,
* Have helped to write a program using the program cards,
* Have helped to start converting the program cards into Python.

Most students:

* Understand that analysis of the problem first makes it easier to turn into code later.
