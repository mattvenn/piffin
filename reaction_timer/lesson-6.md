# Reaction Timer part 2

Last time we made a good start on the software. In the final lesson we'll finish the software, build the hardware and see who's got the fastest reactions!

# Learning objectives

Students will learn:

* We can build useful applications with Python and some electronics,
* Who has the fastest reactions!

# Resources

* 15 Pis and equipment.

## Setup the Pi : 5 minutes

Make a note of the best time. This will be useful to share with other teachers, and with future students!

## Finish writing the code : 20 minutes

Reference code is included here.

***reaction.py

## Build reaction timer hardware : 15 minutes

* Follow circuit diagram to get the hardware ready. 
* Test the led and the button with programs previously written.

Circuit diagrams haven't been included in the final handout as students have already seen and have copies of a button and LED circuit. If they get stuck, you can show them your copy:

### Extension activity

We don't get a great representation of reaction time without making multiple measurements (just like in science). Find a way to repeat the test 3 times and make an average before printing a final score.

## Who's the fastest? : 10 minutes

Now it's time to run the competition! To save time, we'll play a 'sudden death' tournament. If you lose then you get knocked out. 

Ask all pairs to test each other. The winners then play against each other. A class of 30 should only need 5 tests to find the overall winner.

You can ask at the end how to make the competition fairer, as the ways that the students come up with will probably be fairly straight forward to add to our program. For example taking 3 scores and making an average gets rid of the bad luck element.

## Pack away : 5 minutes

Pack away the Pi.

# Homework

Continue from the project started in lesson 4. Students should now have a project description, a circuit diagram and some comments and Python code. The final homework is to write a short presentation on their project. 

They should include:

* Why it's a worthy project,
* Where they think the difficulties are.

If you want to do another Pi project, you could ask the students to present their work and use the most voted project as the starting point.

# Outcome

All students:

* Have built a circuit that can be used for the reaction timer,
* Have had practice converting comments into Python code.

Most students:

* Will have got a working reaction testing program.

Some students:

* Will have added averaging into their program.
