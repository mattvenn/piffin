# Reaction timer

One of the simplest programs and circuits we can make with an LED and a button is a reaction timer.

# Progression

## What do we need?

## Build the circuit: 1 led and 1 button

## Write a program that can listen to the led and light the button

## We need to wait a random length of time and then measure a time interval - introduce libraries: time and random

## Write the main program

# Enhancements

## Depending on how your time, display different messages

## Store the best scores and show them at startup
